We're a passionate and dedicated group of students who make up the Robotics Club of Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, a secondary school located in Flemingdon Park, Toronto. Our club aims to educate students and promote robotics, encouraging teamwork through providing hands-on and interactive experiences with robotics such as holding workshops and competing in tournaments.

# Our History

MGCI Robotics Club has had a relatively short history when compared to other clubs. When we look back at our humble beginnings, we have definitely grown a long way. The club originally started back in 2014 by Saiyam Patel, it was initially had just four who made it to nationals and travelled to Montreal to compete in Zone01. It officially began in 2015 with a total of 14 people, and competed in UOIT's Sumobots. The grade nine team made it to the semifinals and was awarded with the "Best New School Award." We later competed at Zone01 again winning second place. In 2016, we were unable to receive support from the school with regards to supervision and funding. With only 12 members, there was a strong push at Zone01 but it was a lack luster year overall. As most of the seniors had quit except for a kind soul in grade eleven (Jeremy!), the club had lost all of its structure and once again did not receive support from the school. On the bright side, 16 members from grade nine joined! In addition, the club had found its first two females members! 2018 was when the club began restructuring under the influence of the new members. The club decided to focus on training new members and providing teams with smaller robotics competitions to be able to lay a foundation for future growth. We received enough funding to but 2 Mindstorm kits and with borrowed kits from some of the members, we were able to win UOIT Sumobots receiving the best new school and novel design award! In addition to our sudden growth to 36 members, the gender ratio was significantly improving currently sitting at 75% male. In 2019, we continued what had begun in 2018, winning back to back titles at UOIT Sumobots once again and focused on expanding out club. This year, we're continuing our club online online amid the pandemic! Seniors provide online lessons regarding programming, building, strategies and more. With over 40 members this year, over 56% of the team was female! Though our history may be short, it doesn't end here! Make sure to join MGCI robotics if you have the chance!

# A Message from the first president

"MGCI Robotics Club has a long history. Look back at where it came from and appreciate where it is right now. I won’t bore you with all the details of the drama but if you’re curious just ask; are plenty of stories. For future contributors, I recommend you keep track of membership, competition results and the general vision for the club at the time. An effort has been made to track female engagement in a push for diversity in engineering. I encourage you to continue with outreach to those who are less privileged at MGCI; everyone deserves a chance to experience the beauty of robotics. Be good, dream big, God bless."
